In this project, I experiment with Excel data tools on an airbnb dataset. This project is an on-going progress. As I learn new Excel skills, I will continue to add onto the project.

Tools learnt so far:
* VLOOKUP
* MATCH
* INDEX
* IF statements

After self-learning SQL, I wanted to practice my new-found knowledge. I decided that a music-related dataset would suit for SQL practice, so downloaded a Spotify GB tracks dataset ranging from years 1922-2021. This project is also an on-going progress. After being solid in SQL, I plan to move on to visualise my data using Power BI.
